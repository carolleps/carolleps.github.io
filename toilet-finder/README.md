## Accessible toilets at stations and stops - <a href="http://stud20.ultimoweb.org/inclusivIT/" target="_blank">Live version</a>
        

### Intro section

This project is a response to a GovHack challenge. It's a map web application to assist people in finding accessible toilets when they are using public transport

### Main Functions
* User can see all the train stations, wharfs and light rail of NSW (including interstate destinations)
* User can filter the results to show only stops with accessible toilets
* User can select location by address
* When clicking a marker on the map, user can see more information about accessibility and facilities on that location

### Technical Aspects
* Markers are displayed using Google Maps API
* Location and Information about facilities and accessibility are retrieved from an NSW Government dataset
* Dataset: https://opendata.transport.nsw.gov.au/dataset/public-transport-location-facilities-and-operators - File [LocationFacilityData.csv] downloaded on 7/9/19 from Transport for NSW's Open Data Portal.
